digimon is amazing The Digimon franchise began as a series of virtual pets created by WiZ and Bandai, intended as a masculine counterpart to the more female-oriented Tamagotchi pets.[2][3] It was released in June 1997[1][4] with the name Digimon,[5] short for Digital Monster.[6][7] This device shows to players a virtual pet composed entirely of data and designed to play and fight.[1][5][8][9] In February 1998, the DigiMon fighting game, compatible with Windows 95 and developed by Rapture Technologies, Inc., was announced.[10] The one-shot manga C'mon Digimon, designed by Tenya Yabuno, was published in the Japanese magazine V-Jump by Shueisha in 1997.[11][12]

A second generation of virtual pets was marketed six months after the launch of the first, followed by a third in 1998.[13] Each player starts with a baby-level digital creature that has a limited number of attacks and transformations[14] and to make the creature stronger by training and nourishing the creature;[1][5] when the player is successful in a workout, the Digimon becomes strong, when the player fails, the Digimon becomes weak.[1][5] Two devices can be connected, allowing two players to battle with their respective creatures, an innovation at the time,[1] however, the battle is only possible from the moment the creature is in the child level or bigger.[1] Playgrounds and subways were where the majority of users of the apparatus were concentrated; The virtual pet was banned in some Asian schools by being considered by parents and teachers as very noisy and violent.[15] The first Digimon were created by Japanese designer Kenji Watanabe, influenced by American comics, which were beginning to gain popularity in Japan, and as such began to make his characters look stronger and "cool." Other types of Digimon, which until the year 2000 totalled 279,[16][17] came from extensive discussions and collaborations between the Bandai company members.[18]

The original Digital Monster model that was released in 1997 sold 14 million units worlThough most works in the franchise are contained within their own continuity, they all share basic setting and lore elements. Most Digimon stories begin with a human child coming into contact with a Digimon, either through accidentally entering the Digital World [21] or encountering a Digimon who has come into the human world.[22] The child or children will find themselves equipped with a "digivice", a device modelled after the series' virtual pets that enables them to empower their partner Digimon.

While some digimon act like wild beasts, many form small societies and follow governing bodies such as the Royal Knights[23] or Digimon Sovereign.[24] Digimon can grow through evolution (or "digivolution" in most English-language dubs) by absorbing additional data and changing forms; the process is normally linear but there are other methods. For example, "Jogress" (a portmanteau of "joint progress"; "DNA Digivolution" in most English-language dubs)[25] is when two or more Digimon combine into a single being. Though evolution can occur naturally, Digimon can progress faster and into stronger forms when partnered with a human.
